REDDITOR is a web app where similar to reddit and facebook where you can browse the feed, create, delete, update your own posts, sharing some information about yourself. You can also write posts as articles. The app is easy to use. The navbar at the top is gonna allow you to navigate from one page to another. Feed is gonna send you to the main page. You can enter your Profile page by clicking My Profile. !Note, make sure to sign-up before entering your profile page. In the profile page you can see your own posts. You can either delete or edit them.

TO RUN APP LOCALLY:
!Note the application was built using pnpm as a package manager. I chose this tool for its superiority over npm in terms of the speed of installing packages and for additional features it offers.
Please download the zip file or clone the repository via link provided below. Then, enter following command in the terminal to install all the necessary packages: pnpm install.
For this app I used the following packages: pug, body-parser, dotenv, nodemon.
Addionally I used latest es6 syntax for imports and exports hence in my package.json I set "type": "module";
Once you have downloaded the packages feel free to run app on port = localhost:4000 or any other port
Then run this command in the terminal: pnpm run dev/pnpm dev (to run with nodemon)
and pnpm start (to run via node)

THE CHOSEN FOLDER STRUCTURE
For my project I used the folder structure provided in the CW description with insignificant adjustments.
